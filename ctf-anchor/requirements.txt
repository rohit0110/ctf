Capture the flag
Core Game Mechanics
Game Objective
Last person holding the flag when the round ends wins
Players compete to capture flag within 2-hour rounds
Victory awards 80% of prize pool
Player Resources
Initial Health: 100 points per player
Health is consumed on each capture attempt
No health regeneration during game
Cannot capture flag when health depletes
Capture Mechanics
Base Capture Cost: 15 health points
Global Modifier: +5 health per 10 global captures
Maximum Health Cost Cap: 30 health points
Players cannot capture if remaining health < required cost
Time Mechanics
Round Duration: 2 hours (7200 seconds)
Time Extension: +5 minutes if flag captured in last 5 minutes
Game ends when time expires with no captures in final 5 minutes
Economic Model
Monetary Costs
Base capture fee: 1-2 tokens (configurable per game instance)
Fee goes to prize pool
Support for native token and custom tokens across different game instances
Prize Distribution
Winner Share: 80% of prize pool
Protocol Revenue: 20% of prize pool
Portion for participation rewards
Portion for protocol treasury
Game States
Round States
Pending: Game created, awaiting start
Active: Players can capture flag
Final Phase: Last 5 minutes with possible extensions
Completed: Winner determined, prizes distributed
Player States
Active: Has sufficient health to capture
Critical: Low health (below 25 points)
Eliminated: Insufficient health for minimum capture
Technical Implementation
Health Calculation Formula
captureHealthCost = min(
    baseCost + (floor(globalCaptures/10) * globalModifier),
    maxHealthCost
)

Where:
- baseCost = 15
- globalModifier = 5
- maxHealthCost = 30
Health Cost Scaling Breakdown
The health cost for capturing the flag increases as more global captures occur:

Early Game (Captures 0-9):

Floor(0-9/10) = 0
Cost = 15 + (0 * 5) = 15 health
Players pay minimum health cost
Mid Game Phase 1 (Captures 10-19):

Floor(10-19/10) = 1
Cost = 15 + (1 * 5) = 20 health
First difficulty increase
Mid Game Phase 2 (Captures 20-29):

Floor(20-29/10) = 2
Cost = 15 + (2 * 5) = 25 health
Second difficulty increase
Late Game (Captures 30+):

Floor(30+/10) = 3+
Raw cost would exceed 30
Capped at maxHealthCost = 30
Strategic Implications
Early game encourages participation with lower health costs
Progressive scaling creates urgency to capture early
Cost stabilization at 30 prevents game stagnation
Players must balance early cheap captures vs saving health for late game
With 100 initial health, players can make:
6-7 captures in early game
5 captures in mid game phase 1
4 captures in mid game phase 2
3 captures in late game
